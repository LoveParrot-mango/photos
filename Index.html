    <p1> I love photography. It has become by passion now and I always try to enhance it by taking pictures, reading passages of how to take a stunning picture, watching a few videos, etc. Here, you can have a look at some pictures I have taken with a little discription of what it is, and some other pictures that many photographers have taken with their name on the botom and where it is from. </p1>

            <r1 id="reason"> This is a picture I took in the car while we were going to someone's house. What makes this pictures extra funny is the gum stickiing put of my little sister's, Guneet's, mouth.</r1>

While we were waiting, my sister was enjoying a song and zi quickly took a picture of her. After that, I edited it and when I showed it to her, she adored it.</r5>
